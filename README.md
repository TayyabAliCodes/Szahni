I worked on developing the website for Chalet S'ZÃ¤hni, a premium chalet rental located in the stunning Swiss Alps near Zermatt. The website allows users to explore and book either the entire chalet or individual apartments, accommodating up to 11 guests. The project focused on creating a clean, responsive user interface, integrating booking functionality, and showcasing the beauty and amenities of the chalet through a modern, intuitive design.

Key features:

Fully responsive design optimized for all devices
Integration of booking system for seamless reservations
High-quality image galleries and descriptions to enhance user engagement
Multi-language support for international visitors
